# introduction

the individual components of software—are tested. Developers write unit tests for their code to make sure that the code works correctly. This helps to detect and protect against bugs in the future.

Sometimes developers write unit tests *first*
, then write the code. This approach is also known as test-driven development (TDD). In TDD, requirements are turned into specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests. In this approach, no code is added that hasn’t been proven to meet defined requirements. Unit testing is similar, in that it allows developers to modify code without affecting the functionality of other units or the product, as a whole.

# advantages

1. **Any bugs are found easily and quicker**
    - Code covered with tests is more reliable than the code without. If a future change breaks something in the code, developers will be able to identify the root of the problem
2. **Unit testing saves time and money**
    - When unit tests are written, many bugs are found at the software construction stage, which prevents the transition of these bugs to the following stages, including after the release of the product. This saves the costs of fixing the bugs later in the development lifecycle and also brings benefits to end-users, who don’t have to deal with a buggy product.
3. **Unit testing provides documentation**
    - Unit tests are a kind of living documentation of the product. To learn what functionality is provided by one module or another, developers can refer to unit tests to get a basic picture of the logic of the module and the system as a whole.
4. **R2: Reusable and Reliable**
